## What is Agno?

**URL:** llms-txt#what-is-agno?

Source: https://docs.agno.com/introduction

**Agno is an incredibly fast multi-agent framework, runtime and control plane.**

Use it to build multi-agent systems with memory, knowledge, human in the loop and MCP support. You can orchestrate agents as multi-agent teams (more autonomy) or step-based agentic workflows (more control).

Hereâ€™s an example of an Agent that connects to an MCP server, manages conversation state in a database, and is served using a FastAPI application that you can interact with using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com).

```python agno_agent.py lines theme={null}
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

---

## Install dependencies

**URL:** llms-txt#install-dependencies

pip install "agno[infra]" openai exa_py python-dotenv

4. Create a new project with [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction):

```bash
ag infra create              # Choose: [1] agent-infra-docker (default)

## A2A

**URL:** llms-txt#a2a

**Contents:**
- Setup

Source: https://docs.agno.com/agent-os/interfaces/a2a/introduction

Expose your Agno Agent via the A2A protocol

Google's [Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/what-is-a2a/) aims at creating a standard way for Agents to communicate with each other.

Agno integrates seamlessly with A2A, allowing you to expose your Agno Agent and Teams in a A2A compatible way.

This is done with our `A2A` interface, which you can use with our [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction) runtime.

You just need to set `a2a_interface=True` when creating your `AgentOS` instance and serve it as normal:

By default all the Agents, Teams and Workflows in the AgentOS will be exposed via `A2A`.

You can also specify which Agents, Teams and Workflows to expose:

```python a2a-interface-initialization.py theme={null}
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.os.interfaces.a2a import A2A

agent = Agent(name="My Agno Agent")

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
By default all the Agents, Teams and Workflows in the AgentOS will be exposed via `A2A`.

You can also specify which Agents, Teams and Workflows to expose:

**Contents:**
- The Problem with Knowledge-Free Agents
- Real-World Impact
  - Intelligent Text-to-SQL Agents
  - Customer Support Excellence
  - Internal Knowledge Assistant
- Ready to Get Started?

Source: https://docs.agno.com/concepts/knowledge/overview

Understand why Knowledge is essential for building intelligent, context-aware AI agents that provide accurate, relevant responses.

Imagine asking an AI agent about your company's HR policies, and instead of generic advice, it gives you precise answers based on your actual employee handbook. Or picture a customer support agent that knows your specific product details, pricing, and troubleshooting guides. This is the power of Knowledge in Agno.

## The Problem with Knowledge-Free Agents

Without access to specific information, AI agents can only rely on their general training data. This leads to:

* **Generic responses** that don't match your specific context
* **Outdated information** from training data that's months or years old
* **Hallucinations** when the agent guesses at facts it doesn't actually know
* **Limited usefulness** for domain-specific tasks or company-specific workflows

### Intelligent Text-to-SQL Agents

Build agents that know your exact database schema, column names, and common query patterns. Instead of guessing at table structures, they retrieve the specific schema information needed for each query, ensuring accurate SQL generation.

### Customer Support Excellence

Create a support agent with access to your complete product documentation, FAQ database, and troubleshooting guides. Customers get accurate answers instantly, without waiting for human agents to look up information.

### Internal Knowledge Assistant

Deploy an agent that knows your company's processes, policies, and institutional knowledge. New employees can get onboarding help, and existing team members can quickly find answers to complex procedural questions.

**Contents:**
  - Core Intelligence
  - Memory, Knowledge, and Persistence
  - Execution & Control
  - Runtime & Evaluation
  - Security & Privacy

Source: https://docs.agno.com/introduction/features

Agno is built for real-world **Agent Engineering**, helping engineers build, deploy, and scale multi-agent systems in production. Here are some key features that make Agno stand out:

### Core Intelligence

* **Model Agnostic**: Works with any model provider so you can use your favorite LLMs.

* **Type Safe**: Enforce structured I/O through `input_schema` and `output_schema` for predictable, composable behavior.

* **Dynamic Context Engineering**: Inject variables, state, and retrieved data on the fly into context. Perfect for dependency-driven agents.

### Memory, Knowledge, and Persistence

* **Persistent Storage**: Give your Agents, Teams, and Workflows a database to persist session history, state, and messages.

* **User Memory**: Built-in memory system that allows Agents to recall user-specific context across sessions.

* **Agentic RAG**: Connect to 20+ vector stores (called **Knowledge** in Agno) with hybrid search + reranking out of the box.

* **Culture (Collective Memory)**: Shared knowledge that compounds across agents and time.

### Execution & Control

* **Human-in-the-Loop**: Native support for confirmations, manual overrides, and external tool execution.

* **Guardrails**: Built-in safeguards for validation, security, and prompt protection.

* **Agent Lifecycle Hooks**: Pre- and post-hooks to validate or transform inputs and outputs.

* **MCP Integration**: First-class support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect Agents with external systems.

* **Toolkits**: 113+ built-in toolkits with thousands of tools â€” ready for use across domains like data, code, web, and enterprise APIs.

### Runtime & Evaluation

* **Runtime**: Pre-built FastAPI based runtime with SSE compatible endpoints, ready for production on day 1.

* **Control Plane (UI)**: Integrated interface to visualize, monitor, and debug agent activity in real time.

* **Natively Multimodal**: Agents can process and generate text, images, audio, video, and files.

* **Evals**: Measure your Agents' Accuracy, Performance, and Reliability.

### Security & Privacy

* **Private by Design**: Runs entirely in your cloud. The UI connects directly to your AgentOS from your browser â€” no data is ever sent externally.

* **Data Governance**: Your data lives securely in your Agent database, with no external data sharing or vendor lock-in.

* **Access Control**: Role-based access (RBAC) and per-agent permissions to protect sensitive contexts and tools.

Every part of Agno is built for real-world deployment, where developer experience meets production performance.

Expose your Agno Agent via the AG-UI protocol

AG-UI, the [Agent-User Interaction Protocol](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui), standardizes how AI agents connect to front-end applications.

<Note>
  **Migration from Apps**: If you're migrating from `AGUIApp`, see the [v2 migration guide](/how-to/v2-migration#7-apps-interfaces) for complete steps.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install backend dependencies">
    
  </Step>

<Step title="Run the backend">
    Expose an Agno Agent through the AG-UI interface using `AgentOS` and `AGUI`.

<Step title="Run the frontend">
    Use Dojo (`ag-ui`'s frontend) as an advanced, customizable interface for AG-UI agents.

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git`
    2. Install dependencies in `/ag-ui/typescript-sdk`: `pnpm install`

- Build your first Agent

Source: https://docs.agno.com/introduction/quickstart

Build and run your first Agent using Agno.

**Agents are AI programs where a language model controls the flow of execution.**

In 10 lines of code, we can build an Agent that uses tools to achieve a task.

## Build your first Agent

Instead of a toy demo, let's build an Agent that you can extend and build upon. We'll connect our agent to the Agno MCP server, and give it a database to store conversation history and state.

**This is a simple yet complete example that you can extend by connecting to any MCP server**.

```python agno_agent.py lines theme={null}
from agno.agent import Agent

- Overview
- What is A Template?
- Here's How They Work

Source: https://docs.agno.com/deploy/introduction

How to take your AgentOS to production

You can build, test, and improve your AgentOS locally, but to run it in production youâ€™ll need to deploy it to your own infrastructure. Because itâ€™s pure Python code, youâ€™re free to deploy AgentOS anywhere. To make things easier, weâ€™ve also put together a set of ready to use templates - standardized codebases you can use to quickly deploy AgentOS to your own infrastructure.

Currently supported templates:

Docker Template: [agent-infra-docker](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-docker)
AWS Template: [agent-infra-aws](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-aws)

* Modal Template
* Railway Template
* Render Template
* GCP Template

## What is A Template?

A template is a standardized codebase for a production AgentOS. It contains:

* An AgentOS instance using FastAPI.
* A Database for storing Sessions, Memories, Knowledge and Evals.

They are setup to run locally using docker and on cloud providers. They're a fantastic starting point and exactly what we use for our customers. You'll definitely need to customize them to fit your specific needs, but they'll get you started much faster.

## Here's How They Work

**Step 1**: Create your codebase using: `ag infra create` and choose a template.

This will clone one of our templates and give you a starting point.

**Step 2**: `cd` into your codebase and run locally using docker: `ag infra up`

This will start your AgentOS instance and PostgreSQL database locally using docker.

**Step 3 (For AWS template)**: Run on AWS: `ag infra up prd:aws`

This will start your AgentOS instance and PostgreSQL database on AWS.

We recommend starting with the `agent-infra-docker` template and taking it from there.

## Performance

**URL:** llms-txt#performance

**Contents:**
- Agent Performance
  - Instantiation Time

Source: https://docs.agno.com/introduction/performance

Get extreme performance out of the box with Agno.

If you're building with Agno, you're guaranteed best-in-class performance by default. Our obsession with performance is necessary because even simple AI workflows can spawn hundreds of Agents and because many tasks are long-running -- stateless, horizontal scalability is key for success.

At Agno, we optimize performance across 3 dimensions:

1. **Agent performance:** We optimize static operations (instantiation, memory footprint) and runtime operations (tool calls, memory updates, history management).
2. **System performance:** The AgentOS API is async by default and has a minimal memory footprint. The system is stateless and horizontally scalable, with a focus on preventing memory leaks. It handles parallel and batch embedding generation during knowledge ingestion, metrics collection in background tasks, and other system-level optimizations.
3. **Agent reliability and accuracy:** Monitored through evals, which weâ€™ll explore later.

Let's measure the time it takes to instantiate an Agent and the memory footprint of an Agent. Here are the numbers (last measured in Oct 2025, on an Apple M4 MacBook Pro):

* **Agent instantiation:** \~3Î¼s on average
* **Memory footprint:** \~6.6Kib on average

We'll show below that Agno Agents instantiate **529Ã— faster than Langgraph**, **57Ã— faster than PydanticAI**, and **70Ã— faster than CrewAI**. Agno Agents also use **24Ã— lower memory than Langgraph**, **4Ã— lower than PydanticAI**, and **10Ã— lower than CrewAI**.

<Note>
  Run time performance is bottlenecked by inference and hard to benchmark accurately, so we focus on minimizing overhead, reducing memory usage, and parallelizing tool calls.
</Note>

### Instantiation Time

Let's measure instantiation time for an Agent with 1 tool. We'll run the evaluation 1000 times to get a baseline measurement. We'll compare Agno to LangGraph, CrewAI and Pydantic AI.

<Note>
  The code for this benchmark is available [here](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/evals/performance). You should run the evaluation yourself on your own machine, please, do not take these results at face value.

  - `GET /whatsapp/status`
  - `GET /whatsapp/webhook`
  - `POST /whatsapp/webhook`

Source: https://docs.agno.com/agent-os/interfaces/whatsapp/introduction

Host agents as Whatsapp Applications.

Use the WhatsApp interface to serve Agents or Teams via WhatsApp. It mounts webhook routes on a FastAPI app and sends responses back to WhatsApp users and threads.

Follow the WhatsApp setup guide in the [Whatsapp Cookbook](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/main/cookbook/agent_os/interfaces/whatsapp/readme.md).

You will need environment variables:

* `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`
* `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
* `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`
* Optional (production): `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` and `APP_ENV=production`

<Note>
  The user's phone number is automatically used as the `user_id` for runs. This ensures that sessions and memory are appropriately scoped to the user.

The phone number is also used for the `session_id` so a single Whatsapp conversation will be a single session. It is important to take this into account when considering session history.
</Note>

Create an agent, expose it with the `Whatsapp` interface, and serve via `AgentOS`:

See more in our [cookbook examples](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/tree/main/cookbook/agent_os/interfaces/whatsapp/).

* `Whatsapp` (interface): Wraps an Agno `Agent` or `Team` for WhatsApp via FastAPI.
* `AgentOS.serve`: Serves the FastAPI app using Uvicorn.

## `Whatsapp` Interface
