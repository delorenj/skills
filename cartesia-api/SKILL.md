description: Integrate Cartesia speech APIs (TTS, STT, voices) in application code or coding-agent workflows. Use when the user asks about Cartesia REST/WebSocket APIs, SDKs, API keys, Sonic TTS, Ink STT, voice IDs, access tokens, or embedding voice in an app. For Cartesia Line deployed agents, CLI deploy, and telephony, use the line-voice-agent skill instead.
compatibility: Requires a Cartesia API key from https://play.cartesia.ai/keys for server-side calls. Client apps must use short-lived access tokens, not raw API keys. Optional cartesia-mcp requires Python 3.13+.

# Cartesia Voice & Speech APIs

Cartesia provides **text-to-speech (Sonic)**, **speech-to-text (Ink)**, **voices** (library, clone, localize), and related **HTTPS** and **WebSocket** APIs. This skill covers **application integration** and **agent-assisted coding**. For **Cartesia Line** (managed voice agents, `cartesia` CLI, telephony, Line SDK), use **[line-voice-agent](../line-voice-agent/SKILL.md)**.

## Core directives

- **HTTPS only:** All HTTP endpoints use `https://api.cartesia.ai`. WebSockets use `wss://`
  - HTTP may be unsupported; keys used over HTTP can be auto-rotated
- **API version:** Cartesia's API is dated (`Cartesia-Version: YYYY-MM-DD`). Pin **one** version across your services and treat bumping it like a major dependency upgrade — a new version can carry breaking changes — so it's a fixed choice, not a runtime/per-call variable.
  - **With an SDK (recommended):** the SDK already pins a `Cartesia-Version` it was built and tested against. Let it manage that — do **not** override it (e.g. via `default_headers`) with your own date, since the SDK may not work against an arbitrary version. To move to a newer API version, upgrade the SDK.
  - **Calling the API directly (no SDK):** you must send `Cartesia-Version` yourself. Browser WebSockets can't set handshake headers, so pass it as **`?cartesia_version=...`** (query wins if both are present).
  - Optional: `GET https://api.cartesia.ai/` returns `{"ok":true,"version":"..."}` (the gateway's current default), useful when wiring a new client.
- **Server-side auth:** Use **`Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`** with your Cartesia API key (`sk_car_...`).
- **Client apps (browser / mobile):** **Never** embed API keys. Have your backend mint a **short-lived access token** and use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - For WebSockets from browsers, pass the token as **`?access_token=<token>`** (headers are not available on WS handshake)
  - The JS/TS SDK (v3+) runs in the browser with an access token — prefer it over hand-rolling the WebSocket (see its Browser Examples below); don't assume the SDK is server-only
  - See [Access Token API](https://docs.cartesia.ai/api-reference/auth/access-token.md)
- **Errors:** For `Cartesia-Version` **2026-03-01** and newer, errors are **structured JSON** (`error_code`, `title`, `message`, `request_id`, optional `doc_url`)
  - Older versions may return legacy plain-text or legacy JSON structures
  - See [API Errors](https://docs.cartesia.ai/use-the-api/api-errors.md) and [API conventions](https://docs.cartesia.ai/use-the-api/api-conventions.md)
- **Source of truth:** Prefer [docs](https://docs.cartesia.ai) since they are updated first before SDKs / plugins / integrations
  - **Fetch docs as Markdown:** append `.md` to any `docs.cartesia.ai` page to get the agent-readable Markdown (e.g. `https://docs.cartesia.ai/api-reference/stt/transcribe.md`); the bare URL is the human HTML page. Prefer the `.md` form when fetching docs programmatically
  - For machine index: [`llms.txt`](https://docs.cartesia.ai/llms.txt) and [`llms-full.txt`](https://docs.cartesia.ai/llms-full.txt)
- **Optional MCP:** [cartesia-mcp](https://github.com/cartesia-ai/cartesia-mcp) helps in **Cursor / Claude** (files, voice tools)
  - MCP does NOT replace API / SDKs for production
  - Requires **Python 3.13+**
  - See [MCP docs](https://docs.cartesia.ai/tools/ai/mcp.md)

### Text-to-speech with Sonic (generating audio)

- **Choosing a TTS model:** See [TTS models](https://docs.cartesia.ai/build-with-cartesia/tts-models/latest.md) for current model IDs, supported languages, and features. Don't trust a model ID from memory — training data goes stale (e.g. `sonic-2` is no longer current)
- **Voice IDs:** Don't _invent_ a voice ID — a made-up UUID won't resolve. Real voice IDs are **stable**, so hardcoding a real one as a constant is fine and common; copy one from the [playground](https://play.cartesia.ai) or [List Voices](https://docs.cartesia.ai/api-reference/voices/list.md). Use List Voices to _discover/choose_ a voice, not as a required call on every request
- **Choosing an endpoint — bytes vs WebSocket:** if the text is known up front (a fixed string, a button press), use **`POST /tts/bytes`** — it streams audio back as it's generated and is simpler. Reach for the **WebSocket** only when the _input text_ arrives incrementally (e.g. piping an LLM's token stream) — the [continuations](https://docs.cartesia.ai/build-with-cartesia/capability-guides/stream-inputs-using-continuations.md) case. Don't default to WebSockets; compare them in [TTS endpoints](https://docs.cartesia.ai/use-the-api/compare-tts-endpoints.md)
- **Output audio format:** See [TTS output audio format](https://docs.cartesia.ai/build-with-cartesia/capability-guides/tts-output-audio-format.md) for containers/encodings/sample rates (`wav` + `pcm_s16le` @ 44.1 kHz is a safe, self-contained default; `mp3` carries no separate `encoding`)

### Speech-to-text with Ink (transcribing audio)

- **Choosing an STT model:** see [STT models](https://docs.cartesia.ai/build-with-cartesia/stt-models/latest.md) for current models and supported languages
- **Choosing an API endpoint:** see [Compare STT Endpoints](https://docs.cartesia.ai/use-the-api/compare-stt-endpoints.md)
- **Input audio:** see [STT input encodings](https://docs.cartesia.ai/build-with-cartesia/capability-guides/stt-input-encodings.md) for supported formats (self-contained files like `.wav` carry their own header)
- **Before you write any STT code**: read [Common STT Pitfalls](https://docs.cartesia.ai/use-the-api/stt/common-pitfalls.md)
  - Don't assume model or API behavior without grounding it in the docs — small client-side mistakes cause obscure but severe accuracy degradation
  - Common client-side errors:
    - Stripping or inserting whitespace in transcripts (read the model's text **verbatim** — no `.strip()`, no normalization)
    - Improperly concatenating transcript pieces
    - Not following the API spec

### Cartesia Python SDK

## Quick start (HTTP TTS, one-shot)

Shape only: confirm field names and enums against the [API reference](https://docs.cartesia.ai/llms.txt) for your `Cartesia-Version`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cartesia.ai/tts/bytes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CARTESIA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Cartesia-Version: 2026-03-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_id": "sonic-3",
    "transcript": "Hello from Cartesia.",
    "voice": { "id": "f786b574-daa5-4673-aa0c-cbe3e8534c02" },
    "output_format": {
      "container": "wav",
      "encoding": "pcm_s16le",
      "sample_rate": 44100
    },
    "language": "en"
  }' \
  --output /tmp/out.wav
```

## Mental model (for LLMs)

- **Sonic** = TTS Model used to generate speech
- **Ink** = STT Model used to transcribe audio
- **Line** = separate product: you deploy **your** Python agent; Cartesia runs STT/TTS/telephony around it, different from "call TTS API from my server."
- **Concurrency / quota:** Handle `429`-class and structured `concurrency_limited` / `quota_exceeded` per [API errors](https://docs.cartesia.ai/use-the-api/api-errors.md).

## Common mistakes

1. **Overriding the SDK's `Cartesia-Version`**: with an SDK, don't set or override the version — it pins one it's tested against; upgrade the SDK to move versions. Only raw HTTP/WS callers send the date themselves, and then keep one date everywhere (wrong date → subtle breakage or legacy error shapes).
2. **API keys in frontend code**: use short-lived access tokens minted by your backend.
3. **Wrong auth header style**: examples use **`Authorization: Bearer`**; match current docs, not old snippets.
4. **Stale SDK / model code from memory**: training data lags the API. Model IDs drift (e.g. `sonic-2`), and the JS SDK's named `import { CartesiaClient }` is deprecated and won't run in browsers — use `import Cartesia from "@cartesia/cartesia-js"` (or the default import). Confirm models against the models docs and SDK usage against the linked README / examples.
5. **Using this skill for `cartesia deploy` / Line**: switch to **line-voice-agent**.
